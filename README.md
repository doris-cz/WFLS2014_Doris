## About the research
This research aims to explore the potential influential factors of breastfeeding practice and inform potential policy changes that could support breastfeeding practice responsibly. This research uses the “New York City Work and Family Leave Survey (WFLS) 2014” dataset. 

## Data source
WFLS is a telephone survey conducted in March 2016 to understand the availability of paid family leave and its impacts on families. It randomly selected English and Spanish speaking adults who gave birth in New York City in 2014 and who were living with their child at the time of the survey.
